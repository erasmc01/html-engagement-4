        <h1>New 'super-Earth' Discovery</h1>
        <p>The new 'super-Earth' or <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/universe/exoplanets/discovery-alert-a-super-earth-in-the-habitable-zone/">TOI-715 b</a> is comparable to that of our own Earth for countless reasons hence receiving its same. Below is listed the features that make it the new 'super-Earth'.</p>

        <h2>Habitability</h2>
        <p>Planet TOI-715 b nicknamed the new 'super-Earth' is closely identical to our own Earth as it is potentially habitable. Planet TOI-715 b is positioned in the 'conservative' habitable zone of its parent star; a zone in which temperatures allow liquid water to exist on its surface.</p>

       <p>What are its possibilities of being habitable?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Obtains an atmosphere</li>
            <li>Considered as a “water world”</li>
            <li>Sits right in the region of its star where its not too hot or too cold</li>
        </ul>
